 The Rust Programming Language

Welcome! This book will teach you about the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org).  
Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed,  
and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector,  
making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren’t  
good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time  
requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating  
systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a  
number of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while  
eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’  
even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language.  
Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.

“The Rust Programming Language” is split into chapters. This introduction  
is the first. After this:

* [Getting started](getting-started.html) - Set up your computer for Rust development.
* [Tutorial: Guessing Game](guessing-game.html) - Learn some Rust with a small project.
* [Syntax and Semantics](syntax-and-semantics.html) - Each bit of Rust, broken down into small chunks.
* [Effective Rust](effective-rust.html) - Higher-level concepts for writing excellent Rust code.
* [Nightly Rust](nightly-rust.html) - Cutting-edge features that aren’t in stable builds yet.
* [Glossary](glossary.html) - A reference of terms used in the book.
* [Bibliography](bibliography.html) - Background on Rust's influences, papers about Rust.
